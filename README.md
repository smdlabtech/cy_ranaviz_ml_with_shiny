Here's the link to the application : [Visual Analytics for ML]( https://smd-lab-tech.shinyapps.io/Shiny_Dataviz/) and the [report.pdf](/rprt_ana_donnee_avancees_22-1.pdf) containing a case study for interpreting your results.  


## Summary :
Development of a predictive model for the "display" variable using Machine Learning techniques by transforming all continuous variables into categorical for modeling.

### 1. Data Presentation
Description and descriptive analysis of qualitative and quantitative variables, and their transformation for analysis.

### 2. Multiple Component Analysis (MCA)
Use of MCA to reduce data dimensionality, identification of principal components, and their interpretation.

### 3. Modeling
- **Decision Tree**: Used for classification with specific parameters and a confusion matrix to assess performance.
- **Random Forest**: Application of the random forest approach, parameter setting, and classification results.
- **Logistic Regression**: Prediction using logistic regression, details on error rates, and predictions.

### 4. Model Comparison
Comparative analysis of three machine learning models : Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

### 5. Model Performance (Analysis of the best model)
Evaluation of the performance of different models in terms of precision and sensitivity.
